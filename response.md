# Response to Fine-Grained Modularity Approach

## Understanding the Approach

The approach you've seen in other projects involves creating separate modules for each domain class, where:

- Each domain class gets its own module
- Implementation details are hidden within the module
- External and internal interfaces are provided via Spring @Services
- Some projects even include API endpoints within these modules

## Comparison with Our Proposed Structure

Our migration plan proposes a more coarse-grained modular structure with 5 main modules:

1. **Core Module**: Base abstractions and utilities
2. **Domain Module**: All entity definitions and business logic
3. **Rules Module**: Rule definitions and processing
4. **Repository Module**: Data access objects and persistence
5. **Web Module**: REST controllers and API concerns

## Analysis of Fine-Grained Approach

### Potential Benefits

- **Maximum Encapsulation**: Each domain concept is fully isolated
- **Clear Ownership**: Teams can own specific domain modules
- **Focused Development**: Changes to one domain concept don't affect others
- **Independent Deployment**: Theoretically, modules could be deployed separately

### Significant Drawbacks

- **Excessive Fragmentation**: For IDORIS with entities like TypeProfile, AtomicDataType, Operation, etc., this would
  create many small modules
- **Increased Complexity**: Managing dependencies between numerous small modules becomes challenging
- **Overhead**: Each module requires its own configuration, build setup, etc.
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Difficult to handle concerns that span multiple domain classes
- **Tight Coupling**: Despite the separation, domain classes often have inherent relationships (e.g., TypeProfile
  inherits from DataType)
- **API Endpoint Location**: As you noted, placing API endpoints in domain modules violates separation of concerns

## Recommendation for IDORIS

I recommend staying with the more balanced approach outlined in our migration plan for several reasons:

1. **Domain Cohesion**: The entities in IDORIS are closely related (inheritance relationships, references between
   entities). Keeping them in a single domain module maintains this cohesion while still providing clear boundaries.

2. **Appropriate Separation**: The 5-module structure already provides good separation of concerns without excessive
   fragmentation:
    - Domain logic is separated from persistence
    - Web concerns are isolated from business logic
    - Rules system has its own boundary

3. **Practical Maintainability**: A moderate number of well-defined modules is easier to maintain than dozens of tiny
   modules.

4. **Alignment with Spring Modulith**: The Spring Modulith approach generally favors "right-sized" modules that
   represent meaningful business capabilities, not individual entities.

## Alternative Approach

If you want more fine-grained structure without the drawbacks of separate modules for each entity, consider:

1. **Sub-packages within modules**: Within the domain module, create clear sub-packages for related entities:
   ```
   domain
   ├── datatype
   │   ├── AtomicDataType.java
   │   ├── DataType.java
   │   ├── DataTypeService.java
   │   └── internal/
   ├── typeprofile
   │   ├── TypeProfile.java
   │   ├── TypeProfileService.java
   │   └── internal/
   └── operation
       ├── Operation.java
       ├── OperationService.java
       └── internal/
   ```

2. **Package-private visibility**: Use package-private methods and classes to hide implementation details while keeping
   related code in the same module.

3. **Clear interfaces**: Define public interfaces for each domain concept that other packages can depend on.

This approach gives you many of the benefits of fine-grained modularity without the overhead of separate build modules.

## Conclusion

While the approach of separate modules for each domain class offers maximum isolation, it introduces complexity that
likely outweighs its benefits for IDORIS. The proposed 5-module structure in our migration plan provides a good balance
between separation of concerns and practical maintainability.

I agree with your assessment that placing API endpoints in domain modules is not ideal, as it violates the separation
between domain logic and web concerns. Keeping controllers in a dedicated web module, as outlined in our plan, is a
better approach.
