## Installation of Neo4j

IDORIS relies on the Neo4j graph database.
The following command will start a Neo4j instance with the necessary plugins and configuration.
If you want demo data to be loaded, execute this command in this directory.
All data will be stored in the `neo4j-data` directory.
The password for the Neo4j user `neo4j` is `superSecret`.
You can access the Neo4j browser at http://localhost:7474.

```
docker run \
-p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
--name neo4j-apoc-gds-idoris \
--volume=$(pwd)/neo4j-data:/data \

## Running IDORIS

You need to have JDK 21 installed on your system.

For macOS, you can install it using Homebrew: ```brew install openjdk@21```.

For Fedora, you can install it using DNF: ```sudo dnf install java-21```.

Configure the [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties) file to contain the Neo4j API
credentials.

```
spring.application.name=idoris
logging.level.root=INFO
spring.neo4j.uri=bolt://localhost:7687
spring.neo4j.authentication.username=neo4j
spring.neo4j.authentication.password=superSecret
# Base path for all REST endpoints
server.servlet.context-path=/api
server.port=8095
idoris.validation-level=info
idoris.validation-policy=strict
```

When Neo4j is running, start IDORIS with the following command:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

You can access the IDORIS API at http://localhost:8095/api.

## Architecture

IDORIS is built using Spring Boot and follows a modular, event-driven architecture using Spring Modulith.

### Event-Based Architecture

IDORIS uses an event-based architecture to decouple components and improve maintainability. Key events include:

- EntityCreatedEvent: Published when a new entity is created
- EntityUpdatedEvent: Published when an entity is updated
- EntityDeletedEvent: Published when an entity is deleted
- PIDGeneratedEvent: Published when a PID is generated for an entity

For more details, see [event-based-architecture.md](event-based-architecture.md).

### API Documentation

IDORIS provides comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger. You can access the API documentation
at http://localhost:8095/swagger-ui.html when the application is running.

All endpoints support HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) and return HAL (Hypertext Application
Language) responses, making the API self-discoverable.
